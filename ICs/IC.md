## Details for each Integrated Circuit

### 74HC595 - 8-Bit Shift Register With 3-State Output Registers

    RelayDriver - use of the 74HC595 output shift register, with a relay class build to handle functionality.
    3 Code pins:
        SER_Pin - Serial pin
        RCLK_Pin - Latch pin
        SRCLK_Pin - Clock Pin

    #### TestCode: Code uses a class based approach and no delay function calls.
