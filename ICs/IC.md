# Integrated Circuits (IC's)
I bought an 'assortment' back of IC in the 74HCXXX hi speed SI-Gate CMOS Logic ICs, and though i'd see if i could put some simple coding together, in an attempt to become 'quickly' familiar with reading tech docs etc, because practice certainly helps in limiting mistakes later on.

## IC's, their logic, and details on coding and usage.
